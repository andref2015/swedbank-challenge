## Goal
Build a simple multi-step application wizard with a loan payment calculator using vanilla JavaScript. UI/UX should feel Swedbank-like: clean, simple, calm, and professional. Visual perfection is not required.

## General Requirements
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript only (no frameworks)
- Single-page application (SPA-style)
- Works in modern browsers (Chrome / Firefox)
- Delivered as a ZIP file (open via index.html)

## Flow
- Intro: short intro + “Start application” button
- Wizard (4 steps, one visible at a time)

### Step 1 – Employment status
- Radio buttons (Employed / Self-employed / Unemployed)
- Required

### Step 2 – Income + Loan Calculator
- Income dropdown (e.g. <1000€, 1000–2000€, >2000€)
- Loan amount input or slider
- Loan period dropdown (12 / 24 / 36 months)
- Interest rate dropdown (fixed options)
- Display monthly payment (formula may be referenced from Wikipedia)

### Step 3 – Consents
- 2–3 checkboxes
- At least one required

### Step 4 – Additional info
- Textarea (min. 10 characters)

## Summary
- Display all answers and calculated monthly payment
- Submit does not send data anywhere (UI only)

## Bonus (optional)
- Accessibility (labels, keyboard navigation)
- README with setup notes
- Separate pure JS function for loan calculation
